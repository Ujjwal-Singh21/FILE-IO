Nadeemâ€“Shravan were the most successful Bollywood music directors of the 1990s until the early 2000s. 
They displayed a strong influence of Hindustani (classical / semi-classical) music in their compositions, 
and were the only composers during the 1990s and 2000s who relied heavily on three particular instruments: 
the bansuri, the sitar and the shehnai in almost all of their songs.
